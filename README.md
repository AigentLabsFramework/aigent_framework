# Aigent Framework: Open-Source Solana Agent Framework

An open-source framework on Solana for building secure, monetizable, and scalable agent-driven transaction systems. Aigent Framework empowers developers, contributors, and dApp builders to create, utilize, and profit from a robust platform that ensures trustless interactions for everyday use cases.

## Overview
Aigent Framework is a Solana-based system designed to secure transactions between parties in a trustless way. Whether you're building a dApp for rentals, peer-to-peer services, or any transaction-based platform, Aigent provides the core features to make it happen. It’s deployed on devnet at `HNjDWKszkwv9NmQKVrzfC42Qg6R78C1EUtvHLtfJTASx`.

- **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and contribute to.
- **Monetizable:** Built-in revenue models for creators and contributors.
- **Secure:** Leverages Solana’s speed and security for trustless transactions.

## Core Features
Aigent Framework’s unique features make it a go-to for secure transactions:
- **Agent-Driven Mediation:** Agents (human or smart contracts) oversee transactions, ensuring fairness and resolving disputes.
- **Transaction Security:** Supports SOL and SPL tokens with built-in mechanisms to lock and release funds securely.
- **Dispute Resolution:** A structured process for handling disagreements, with agents stepping in to settle disputes.
- **Everyday Use Cases:** From renting a bike to booking a freelancer, Aigent secures any peer-to-peer transaction—think of it as a backbone for your daily needs like short-term rentals, service agreements, or even event ticketing.

## Role of Agents
Agents are the heart of Aigent Framework:
- **Mediation:** Agents ensure transactions go smoothly, stepping in if things go south.
- **Dispute Resolution:** They make final calls on disputes, splitting funds fairly between parties.
- **Automation Potential:** Future updates will let agents be smart contracts, making the system fully decentralized.

## dApps Integration
Aigent Framework is built for dApp developers:
- **Use Case:** Power dApps for rentals, freelance gigs, or ticketing systems with secure transaction flows.
- **API:** Exposes Solana programs for easy integration into your dApp.
- **Frontend Ready:** Pair it with a frontend (e.g., React, Next.js) for a seamless user experience.

## Scalability
Built on Solana, Aigent Framework is ready to grow:
- **High Throughput:** Solana’s 65,000+ TPS handles thousands of transactions per second.
- **Low Costs:** Fees are pennies, perfect for microtransactions.
- **Future Plans:** Sharding and state compression will support millions of users as the ecosystem scales.

## Monetization
Aigent Framework lets everyone profit:
- **DAO Fees:** A small percentage of each transaction goes to a DAO pool, funding development and governance.
- **Agent Earnings:** Developers can create their own Agents or bots using our core ALF framework as the foundation. They set their own fees for it, earning income directly from their creations.
- **dApp Revenue:** Developers can add their own fees, creating a sustainable revenue stream.
